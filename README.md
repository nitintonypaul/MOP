# Multi-Objective Portfolio Allocation Engine

A Python-based engine designed for advanced portfolio optimization

---

## Project Objective

This project aims to develop a **multi-objective portfolio allocation engine** in Python. It provides a versatile framework for exploring and applying various portfolio optimization techniques, including those for high-performance and computationally intensive financial analysis.

## Available Optimizers

* **Variance Optimization:** Focuses on minimizing portfolio variance for a given set of returns.
* **Maximum Diversification Optimization (MDP):** Implements risk diversification strategies beyond simple variance reduction.
* **Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO):** Balances expected return (**Black Litterman**) against portfolio risk by maximizing the difference between expected return and a risk-adjusted variance penalty, aiming for an optimal risk-return trade-off. 
* **Conditional Value-at-Risk Optimization (CVaR):** Focuses on minimizing potential extreme losses beyond a defined confidence level by optimizing the portfolioâ€™s expected tail loss, providing a more conservative risk control framework compared to variance-based methods.
* **Mean-CVaR Optimization (MCVaR):** Seeks to maximize expected portfolio return while controlling downside risk by jointly optimizing for higher returns and lower Conditional Value-at-Risk. This approach balances reward and tail-risk exposure, making it suitable for strategies aiming for attractive risk-adjusted returns under extreme market conditions.

## Installation & Usage

To get started with the engine:

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the ZIP file):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nitintonypaul/MOP.git
    ```
    
2.  **Navigate into the directory:**
    ```bash
    cd MOP
    ```
    
3. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
   - **Windows:**
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **macOS/Linux:**
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```  

4. **Install required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
5.  **Run the demo:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

The core optimization engine is located in the `lib/` directory. You can integrate it into your own Python projects by copying the `lib/` folder.
